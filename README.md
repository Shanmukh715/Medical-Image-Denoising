Medical Image Denoising Project:



This project focuses on removing noise from medical MRI images using different denoising techniques.



Techniques Used:

\- Mean Filter

\- Median Filter

\- Bilateral Filter

\- Wavelet Denoising

\- Non-Local Means (NLM)



Evaluation Metric:

\- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)



Dataset:

\- Brain MRI images (Kaggle)



Tools Used:

\- Python

\- OpenCV

\- NumPy

\- PyWavelets

\- scikit-image



Results:

The project compares the performance of different denoising techniques and shows that Non-Local Means provides the best balance between noise removal and detail preservation.
